🧳 Travel Booking App: 

A Flutter-based travel booking application that allows users to search destinations, book flights, and confirm trips easily.
The app includes multiple pages such as:

Splash Screen

Login / Register screens

Home Page with bottom navigation

Search Trips with destination filtering

Flight Selection, Flight Results, and Booking Confirmation pages

Profile Page with logout feature

⚠️ Note: This project currently does not use Firebase or any backend — it is a frontend-only prototype demonstrating the UI flow and navigation of a travel booking system.

✨ Main Features:

Modern and simple user interface built with Flutter

Navigation between multiple screens (Search, Book, Profile)

Destination search and filtering

Flight booking and confirmation simulation

Clean structure and easy to extend with backend (e.g., Firebase in the future)
